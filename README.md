# NeurIPS-25-Glocal-IB

We've implemented **Glocal-IB** on **SAITS** based on the [PyPOTS](https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyPOTS) and put the code in the `SAITS` folder.

Three different alignment losses, including `foundation model alignment`, `glocal alignment_1`, and `glocal alignment_2,` in `loss.py`.
